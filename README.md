# Drawing Prompt Generator

## ‚å®Ô∏è Technology + Asset stack
HTML / CSS / npm / Node.js / Vite / Font Awesome / Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## üîåAPIs used
- Supabase
    - I created my own database filled with prompts and linked it to the project. This enables prompts to be modified easily. 
- Pexel image API
    - Hosted by Pexel with a very detailed API response enabling flexibility on how it's used in the project. 

## üçº Introduction
While continuing to learn React through Bob Ziroll's Learn React course (Scrimba), I wanted to experiment and practice intergrating APIs into a React project. This web application displays random drawing prompts to users and outputs an image associated with the word. The user can request for a different prompt in which the word and image will change. The prompt obtained from Supabase is required so the second API can execute. This project was interesting as I was using two different APIs in different places but had to pass data from the main app file to the component at a lower level. 

## üé® Design
The design was inspired by a similar project on Frontend Mentor (Advice Generator App) but was adapted to suit the addition of other elements such as the photo, photographer's name and link to their account.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Accessibility intergrated into the 'generate new prompt' (dice) button using aria-label.
- The prompt word is retrieved from Supabase and inserted into the Pexel API to use as context in the search query.
- Images shown are set to be landscape only.
- The photographer of the image is displayed in the card.
- Users can view the photographer's Pexel account.
- The API keys are hidden correctly using the .env file and added to the .gitignore file. 

## ‚ûï Potential features to add 
- Swapping between different themes (e.g. Landscapes, objects, halloween).
- Option to change colour theme.
